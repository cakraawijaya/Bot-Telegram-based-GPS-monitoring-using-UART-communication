# Bot-Telegram-based-GPS-monitoring-using-UART-communication
Theft of goods is rampant in Indonesia today because it is first influenced by economic factors, then the lack of awareness from the local community in protecting their personal belongings, thus creating opportunities for thieves to be able to act. Therefore, this project was created as an effort to improve the security of goods in close proximity. In this case, the author tries to use the UART protocol on the Arduino and Wemos side. This project has been implemented and took approximately 1 month. There are 2 types of development boards used. Arduino Pro Micro is used to hold the coordinate data obtained from the sensor, then send the coordinate data to Wemos D1 Mini using UART communication protocol: Hardware Serial. While the Wemos D1 Mini is used to accommodate coordinate data from the Arduino Pro Micro using the UART communication protocol: Software Serial. Furthermore, the raw data that has been received is processed into useful information, then sent to the Telegram Bot. This Telegram bot can respond to users if there is interaction in it. The benefit of making this project is none other than to add insight. The result of this project is that the coordinates of personal items can be monitored at any time easily and quickly only through Telegram Bot, so that existing items will not be easily stolen.

## Basic Knowledge
Basically, a device can be communicated with other devices either wirelessly or by cable. Communication between commonly used hardware is ``` Serial Communication ```. It can be known that there are three types of ``` Serial Communication ```, which include: ``` UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) ```, ``` SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) ```, and ``` I2C (Inter Integrated Circuit) ```. ``` Serial UART communication ``` allows each device to act as a ``` master ``` or ``` slave ``` in a limited way. ``` Master ``` is the primary device that has full authority over the control of the Slave, while the ``` Slave ``` is the secondary device that is under the authority of the Master device. There are two kinds of ``` UART Serial Communication ```, namely ``` Hardware Serial ``` and ``` Software Serial ```. ``` Hardware serial communication ``` can be done by connecting the ``` TX ``` and ``` RX ``` pins ``` crosswise ``` on each development board, for example: ``` RX-TX ```, then ``` TX-RX ```. The ``` TX ``` pin is for ``` sending data ```, while the ``` RX ``` pin is for ``` receiving data ```. ``` Serial Software Communication ``` is more or less the same as ``` Serial Hardware Communication ``` in terms of cabling, but there are differences in terms of coding. By using this ``` Serial Software ``` you can overcome the constraints of the limitations of ``` RX ``` and ``` TX ``` pins on the development board. To communicate with this ``` Serial Software ``` is quite easy, namely by using certain ``` Digital Pins ``` as a ``` substitute for TX pins and RX pins ```.<br><br>

The ``` Arduino Pro Micro ``` has several pins that can support ``` Software Serial ``` which include :

<blockquote>
   If the item is out of the range of the router, it can be completely lost. To overcome this shortcoming, you can add a GSM module that comes with a SIM card in future research.
